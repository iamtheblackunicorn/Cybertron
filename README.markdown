***Cybertron, an elegant, wide-screen Jekyll theme for freelancers, bloggers, and artists.*** :fire: :alien: :robot:

## Status :warning:

## TODO :note_pad:

You can view the things that still need to be added to this theme [here](TODO.markdown).

## About :books:

The other day I saw a video by an Australian web developer talking about amazing portfolio websites. Now most of these websites used some next-level technologies like *Vue.js*, *Blender* or *D3.js*. My skills might not be as good but I wanted to see if I could build something as impressive using good old-fashioned HTML, CSS, and Javascript. ***Cybertron*** is the result of that.
